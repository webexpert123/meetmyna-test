    <p>(b) temporarily suspend your account; and/or</p>
    <p>(c) cancel your account,</p>

    <p>9.3 We may from time to time vary the benefits associated with a subscription by giving you written notice of the variation, providing that, if in our reasonable opinion such a variation results in a substantial loss of value or functionality, you shall have the right to cancel your subscription, and we will refund to you any amounts paid to us in respect of any period of subscription after the date of such cancellation. As far as possible, we will give as much notice as is reasonable possible</p>
    <p>9.4 At the end of any period of subscription for which you have paid, and subject to the other provisions of these terms and conditions, your subscription will terminate unless renewed per mutual agreement by the parties.</p>

    <p>10.3 You must pay to us the fees in respect of our Services in advance, in cleared funds, in accordance with any instructions given in relation to our Services, unless otherwise agreed. We may appoint an agent or third party to collect fees on our behalf.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>10.4 We may vary fees from time to time by posting new fees on our website, or by notifying you directly, but this will not affect fees for services that have been previously paid.</p>
    <p>10.5 If you dispute any payment made to us, you must contact us immediately and provide full details of your claim.</p>
    <p>10.6 If you make an unjustified credit card, debit card or other charge-back then you will be liable to pay us, within 7 days following the date of our written request:</p>
    <p>(a) an amount equal to the amount of the charge-back;</p>
    <p>(b) all third party expenses incurred by us in relation to the charge-back (including charges made by our or your bank or payment processor or card issuer);</p>

    <p>and for the avoidance of doubt, if you fail to recognise or fail to remember the source of an entry on your card statement or other financial statement, and make a charge-back as a result, this will constitute an unjustified charge-back for the purposes of this Section 10.6.</p>
    <p>10.7 If you owe us any amount under or relating to these terms and conditions, we may suspend or withdraw the provision of services to you.</p>
    <p>10.8 We may at any time set off any amount that you owe to us against any amount that we owe to you, by sending you written notice of the set-off.</p>
    <p>10.9 We may from time to time give free trial access to our Services.

    <p>subject to Section 11.3. You do not have to give any reason for your withdrawal or cancellation.</p>
    <p>11.3 You agree that we may begin the provision of services before the expiry of the period referred to in Section 11.2, and you acknowledge that, if we do begin the provision of services before the end of that period, then:</p>
    <p>(a) if the services are fully performed, you will lose the right to cancel referred to in Section 11.2;</p>
    <p>(b) if the services are partially performed at the time of cancellation, you must pay to us an amount proportional to the services supplied or we may deduct such amount from any refund due to you in accordance with this Section 11.</p>
    <p>11.4 In order to withdraw an offer to contract or cancel a contract on the basis described in this Section 11, you must inform us of your decision to withdraw or cancel (as the case may be). You may inform us by means of any clear statement setting out the decision. In the case of cancellation, you may inform us using the cancellation form that we will make available to you. To meet the cancellation deadline, it is sufficient for you to send your communication concerning the exercise of the right to cancel before the cancellation period has expired.</p>
    <p>11.5 If you withdraw an offer to contract, or cancel a contract, on the basis described in this Section 11, you will receive a full refund of any amount you paid to us in respect of the offer or contract, except as specified in this Section 11.</p>
    <p>11.6 We will refund money using the same method used to make the payment, unless you have expressly agreed otherwise. In any case, you will not incur any fees as a result of the refund.</p>
    <p>11.7 We will process the refund due to you as a result of a cancellation on the basis described in this Section 11 without undue delay and, in any case, within the period of 30 days after the day on which we are informed of the cancellation.</p>
