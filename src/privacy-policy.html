    <p>This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how their &lsquo;Personally Identifiable Information&rsquo; (PII) is being used online. PII, as described in privacy law and information security, is information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context. Please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your PII in accordance with our website.</p>
    <p><strong>What personal information do we collect?</strong></p>
    <p>When ordering services from Myna, registering on our website or signing up for a newsletter you may be asked to enter your name, phone number or other details to help you with your experience.</p>
    <p>Data transferred to Myna or data Myna is given access to may contain your PII or PII of others.</p>
    <p><strong>When do we collect information?</strong></p>
    <p>We collect information from you when you register on our site, place an order, subscribe to a newsletter, fill out a form, open a Support Ticket, submit data to us for processing or enter information on our site. We collect information you transfer to us for processing, under the terms you agree within the processing contract, retaining it for the period defined in the processing contract, or otherwise for such time as is reasonable.</p>
    <p><strong>How do we use your information?</strong></p>
    <p>We may use the information we collect from you when you register, make a purchase, sign up for our newsletter, respond to a survey or marketing communication or use our website, in the following ways:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>To quickly process your requests</li>
    <li>To communicate with you on the status of projects</li>
    <li>For invoicing or billing purposes</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Any &ldquo;Custom Vocabulary&rdquo; or &ldquo;Custom Topics&rdquo; data can be used by us to help us better train our algorithms.We will ask for explicit consent before we use any other data submitted by you to us to assist in better training our algorithms, in order to fully protect your privacy</p>
    <p><strong>How do we protect your information?</strong></p>
    <p>Your personal information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of persons who have special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. In addition, all sensitive information you supply is encrypted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology.</p>
    <p>We implement a variety of security measures when a user places an order enters, submits, or accesses their information to maintain the safety of your personal information.</p>
    <p><strong>Third-party disclosure</strong></p>
    <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your PII. We may release information when its release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others&rsquo; rights, property or safety. If you connect your account to a third party provider such as Dropbox, you are giving us explicit consent to transfer such of your PII to that provider as is strictly necessary to allow us to perform the services we are contracted to provide to you</p>
    <p><strong>Fair Information Practices</strong></p>
    <p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.</p>
    <p><strong>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:</strong></p>
    <p>We will notify you via email</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Within 72 hours</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We will notify the users via in-site notification</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Within 72 hours</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</p>
    <p><strong>CAN SPAM Act</strong></p>
    <p>The CAN-SPAM Act is a US law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.</p>
    <p><strong>We collect your email address in order to:</strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li>Send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions</li>
    <li>Process orders and to send information and updates pertaining to orders.</li>
    <li>Send you additional information related to your product and/or service</li>
    <li>Market to our mailing list or continue to send emails to our clients after the original transaction has occurred.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>To be in accordance with CANSPAM, we agree to the following:</strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li>Not use false or misleading subjects or email addresses.</li>
    <li>Identify the message as an advertisement in some reasonable way.</li>
    <li>Include the physical address of our business or site headquarters.</li>
    <li>Monitor third-party email marketing services for compliance, if one is used.</li>
    <li>Honor opt-out/unsubscribe requests quickly.</li>
    <li>Allow users to unsubscribe by using the link at the bottom of each email.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong><br /> If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, you can email us at support@intelligentvoice.com</strong>&nbsp;or follow the instructions at the bottom of the email and we will promptly remove you from&nbsp;<strong>ALL</strong>&nbsp;correspondence.</p>
    <p><strong>Do we use &lsquo;cookies&rsquo; on meetmyna.com and our other websites?</strong></p>
    <p>Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer&rsquo;s hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the site&rsquo;s or service provider&rsquo;s systems to recognise your browser and capture and remember certain information. For instance, we use cookies to help us remember and process the items in your shopping cart. They are also used to help us understand your preferences based on previous or current site activity, which enables us to provide you with improved services. We also use cookies to help us compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future.</p>
    <p><strong>We use cookies to:</strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li>Understand and save user&rsquo;s preferences for future visits.</li>
    <li>Compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interactions in order to offer better site experiences and tools in the future. We may also use trusted third-party services that track this information on our behalf.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser settings. Since browser is a little different, look at your browser&rsquo;s Help Menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies.</p>
    <p><strong>If users disable cookies in their browser:</strong></p>
    <p>If you turn cookies off, some of the features that make your site experience more efficient may not function properly.</p>
    <p><strong>Google Analytics</strong></p>
    <p>When someone visits one of our websites, Google Analytics collects standard internet log information and details of visitor behaviour patterns. We do this to find out things such as the number of visitors to the various parts of the site. This information is only processed in a way which does not identify anyone. We do not make, and do not allow Google to make, any attempt to find out the identities of those visiting our website.</p>
    <p><strong>Mailchimp</strong></p>
    <p>Our newsletter is delivered using a third party provider, MailChimp.&nbsp;We gather statistics around email opening and clicks using industry standard technologies to help us monitor and improve our e-newsletter. For more information, please see&nbsp;<a href="https://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/">MailChimp&rsquo;s privacy notice</a>. You can unsubscribe to general mailings at any time of the day or night by clicking the unsubscribe link at the bottom of any of our emails.</p>
    <p><strong>California Online Privacy Protection Act</strong></p>
    <p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the USA to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law&rsquo;s reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting PII from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. &ndash; See more at: http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf</p>
    <p><strong>PCI compliance</strong></p>
    <p>In accordance with its obligations under the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (&ldquo;<strong>PCI DSS</strong>&rdquo;), we acknowledge our responsibility for securing cardholder data, and we represent, warrant and covenant that we comply with PCI DSS, all rules and regulations established by the payment card brands and amended from time to time, and all other security protocols, advisories, standards, and guidelines required by the payment card brands (collectively, the &ldquo;<strong>PCI Security Standards</strong>&rdquo;). We will store and use any data captured or collected in strict accordance with the PCI Security Standards and applicable federal, state, and local law and regulations, including, subject to the licenses and restrictions hereunder, the use of tokens, encryption, aggregation, and anonymization.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>GDPR</strong></p>
    <p>Under GPDR you are entitled to view, amend, or delete the personal information that we hold. Email your request to our data protection officer, Andrew Burns at gdpr@meetmyna.com</p>
